            <p>A chicken is a young poultry, male or female, of the subspecies Gallus gallus domesticus, raised for its flesh. If it is the same animal, the production conditions of broilers differ from those of laying hens which are reared for their eggs. For example, the growth rate of laying hens is much less than that of broilers.
            In France the raising of chickens is mostly intensive, that is to say that the animals are raised in large numbers in closed buildings for 35 days on average.The selection of breeders and the development of new types of feeding now make it possible to accelerate the growth of birds in order to produce a lot of muscle, which is not without risk for animal health.

            <p>Beef is meat from animals of the Bos taurus species, whether cow, bull, calf, grazing, bull calf, heifer or beef. It is an agricultural product intended almost exclusively for human consumption.
            Current European legislation accepts that meat from beef, buffalo (including the Levant buffalo raised by Italian farmers for the transformation of its milk into mozarella), bison and zebu be called and labeled "beef". Cutting beef is a cultural practice, so it is different between Anglo-Saxon countries, Germany and France for example.
            It is more commonly called beef, designation which applies to meat from animals of different ages and both sexes of this species (cow, bull, bull calf, heifer or beef), with the exception of veal, for which we usually speak of veal.
            In rich countries, the trend is towards the production of less fatty meats (from cattle carrying the culottes gene) or degreased by trimming during their preparation.
